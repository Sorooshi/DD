Dang! That path collection is out of this world. I totally don't know what to do with it yet! Plotly can only import path collections linked to 'data' coordinates

Looks like the annotation(s) you are trying
to draw lies/lay outside the given figure size.
Therefore, the resulting Plotly figure may not be
large enough to view the full text. To adjust
the size of the figure, use the 'width' and
'height' keys in the Layout object. Alternatively,
use the Margin object to adjust the figure's margins.
