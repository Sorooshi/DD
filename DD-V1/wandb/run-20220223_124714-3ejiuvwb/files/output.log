'random_state' has been introduced in 0.23. It will be set to None starting from 1.0 (renaming of 0.25) which means that results will differ at every function call. Set 'random_state' to None to silence this warning, or to 0 to keep the behavior of versions <0.23.

Precision is ill-defined and being set to 0.0 in labels with no predicted samples. Use `zero_division` parameter to control this behavior.
