[02:56:38] WARNING: ../src/learner.cc:1115: Starting in XGBoost 1.3.0, the default evaluation metric used with the objective 'multi:softprob' was changed from 'merror' to 'mlogloss'. Explicitly set eval_metric if you'd like to restore the old behavior.
/home/soroosh/venv_Jan2022/lib/python3.9/site-packages/xgboost/sklearn.py:1224: UserWarning:
The use of label encoder in XGBClassifier is deprecated and will be removed in a future release. To remove this warning, do the following: 1) Pass option use_label_encoder=False when constructing XGBClassifier object; and 2) Encode your labels (y) as integers starting with 0, i.e. 0, 1, 2, ..., [num_class - 1].
/home/soroosh/anaconda3/lib/python3.9/site-packages/sklearn/metrics/_classification.py:1248: UndefinedMetricWarning:
Precision is ill-defined and being set to 0.0 in labels with no predicted samples. Use `zero_division` parameter to control this behavior.
