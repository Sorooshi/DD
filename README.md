- The first artificial intelligence-based solution with robust results to detect dyslexia from eye-movement data of first- to sixth-grade Russian-speaking school students.

- A comprehensive study of the performance and hyperparameter fine-tuning of ten classifications and seven regression algorithms.

- Propose the first largest eye-movement data set in this area of research consisting of three discrete target values and a continuous one.

- Determine the importance of features in detecting dyslexia which is partially aligned with domain knowledge.
